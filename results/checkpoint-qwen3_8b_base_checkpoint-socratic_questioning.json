      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about how many bolts of fiber are needed to make a robe. The problem states that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the blue fiber is 2 bolts. Then the white fiber is half of that. Wait, half of 2 bolts would be 1 bolt, right?",
      "So, adding them together, 2 bolts for blue and 1 bolt for white, that totals 3 bolts. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says \"half that much white fiber\"\u2014\"that much\" refers to the blue fiber, which is 2 bolts. So half of 2 is indeed 1. So total bolts would be 2 + 1 = 3. \n\nBut maybe I should check if there's another interpretation. Like, could \"half that much\" refer to something else?",
      "No, I think it's straightforward. The blue is 2, white is half of blue. So 2 + 1 = 3. So the answer should be 3 bolts in total. \n\nWait, but the user is asking for the questions, not the answer. The original problem is about the total bolts needed. The user wants a list of questions on one line. Let me see the example they gave. In the first problem, the questions were \"How many eggs does Janet sell?",
      "How much does Janet make at the farmers' market?",
      "\" So they are asking for the key steps. \n\nSo for this problem, the key steps would be: How much white fiber is needed?",
      "How many bolts in total does it take?",
      "Or maybe first, how much white fiber is needed, then total bolts. Let me think. The problem is about calculating the total bolts, so the questions should lead to that. So first, determine the amount of white fiber, then add to blue. So the questions would be: How much white fiber is needed?",
      "How many bolts in total does it take?",
      "That makes sense. Alternatively, maybe \"What is the total number of bolts required for the robe?",
      "\" But the example uses two questions. Let me check the original problem again. The original problem is: A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. How many bolts in total does it take?",
      "So the user wants the questions that lead to solving this. So the first question would be about the white fiber?"

      "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Josh buys a house for $80,000 and then spends $50,000 on repairs. The value of the house increases by 150% because of these repairs. We need to find out how much profit he made.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the 150% increase means. If the original value of the house was $80,000, then a 150% increase would mean the value goes up by 150% of the original price. Wait, but does the 150% increase apply to the original price or the price after repairs?",
      "Hmm, the problem says the repairs increased the value by 150%, so I think it's 150% of the original value. Let me confirm that. \n\nSo, the original value is $80,000. A 150% increase would be 1.5 times the original value. So, the new value after repairs would be $80,000 + (150% of $80,000). Let me calculate that. 150% of 80,000 is 1.5 * 80,000 = $120,000. So the new value is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. \n\nWait, but Josh also spent $50,000 on repairs. So his total cost is the original price plus the repairs: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. Then, if he sells the house for $200,000, his profit would be $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000. \n\nBut let me check if the 150% increase is calculated differently. Maybe the 150% is based on the original value, so the total value after repairs is original value plus 150% of original value. That's what I did. So, 80,000 * 1.5 = 120,000 added to the original 80,000 gives?"
